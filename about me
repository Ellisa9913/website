<h4>The first reason is because UiTM has a low fee and I have to pay the fee less than RM600.
The second reason is because of my parent. They want me to study near them. So, they didn't
worry about me. That's how I end up study here but I'm not care anymore because there is 
something behind all this.</h4>
